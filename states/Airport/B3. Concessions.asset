  storyText: "There appears to normally be all manner of stores, food vendors, shops,
    and services but due to the construction most are closed, or covered in tarps
    so you can barely make out what they are. There's people everywhere moving about
    and peeking through partially closed store-fronts. One area appears quiet and
    disused. \r\n\r\nWhere do you want to go?\r\n\r\n1. To the washrooms\r\n2. Check
    out the food vendors\r\n3. Head to the Convience store\r\n4. Rest in the quiet
    area off to the side\r\n5. Head back to the lobby"
