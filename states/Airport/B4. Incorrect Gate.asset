  storyText: "You're stuck waiting in line. There's people all around you, you can
    barely move. Through the commotion you can just make out that some flight's departure
    time has been bumped up and they're about to depart. Names are called over the
    public address system. Somewhere a child cries. A heavy foot steps on your toe.
    The line could be moving, or maybe it's just the Earth's rotation\r\n\r\nWhat
    now?\r\n\r\n1. Keep waiting\r\n2. Fight your way to to the front of the line\r\n3.
    Go back to the Departures Hall"
