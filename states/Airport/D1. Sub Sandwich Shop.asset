  storyText: "You queue up behind some of the rather smelly construction workers milling
    around the front of the Shop. One of them reaches over all of the meats and veggies
    to grab some mayo, dripping sweat and drywall dust all over. You order and recieve
    a sandwhich, but as you start eating you feel queasy and unwell. The worker nearest
    you burps in your face, you feel sick.\r\n\r\nQuick as you can what do you do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Back to the Concessions area\r\n2. Straight to the Washrooms\r\n3. Sit and rest
    a bit until you feel better\r in the Quite Area\n\r"
