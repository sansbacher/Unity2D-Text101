  storyText: "The conveinience store has the usual selectons of magazines, newspapers,
    snacks, and small things to keep kids amused on flights. The cashier looks impatient
    and she gestures towards a sign that says \"Sorry, cash only\". Fumbling in your
    pockets you find only a few dollars, enough for one, maybe two, items.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you buy?\r\n\r\n1. A newspaper to read on the plane\r\n2. That interesting
    magazine you've been meaning to read\r\n3. Ear plugs in case there's a noisy child
    on the plane so you can sleep\n4. A plain-looking pre-packaged snack\r\n5. Nothing,
    just go back to the Concessions area\r\n"
