  storyText: "There's several different food vendors, though many are closed because
    of the construction or have debris and dust covering much of their surfaces. Workmen
    stand around the only open one, a submarine sandwich shop, dripping paint, glue,
    and other muck all around. Do you dare eat from there? You're running late and
    you swear one of the subs just \"moved\" on its own. But you are fairly hungry.\r\n\r\nWhat's
    your pick?\r\n\r\n1. Try ordering a sub sandwich\r\n2. Check if the conveinence
    has and pre-packaged food\r\n3. Back to the Concessions area\r\n"
