# Text101 module from Udemy's Unity2D course
(from GameDev.tv)

This was my Text101 project, with several additions.

## "I'll Flyaway"

I'm less into designing and more into programming so I added some *PUZZLE / CHALLENGE* elements! There's a clock (you only have a time limit), the gate is randomized (you need to discover it), and there's 2 other objectives you must complete before boarding. Good luck!

There's some code and screenshots from the Unity Editor to show what I did. Hopefully you can re-assemble the came from the various bits and pieces if you'd like rebuild it.

Code is probably excessively commented since I often have to take long breaks from working on this course and come back to it later - the extra comments are to remind me what was going on!

There's a clock that increments with each move/change-of-state (you only have 36 mins!), the departure gate is randomized so you have to discover it, and you need to accomplish 2 things before you can board your plane.

(credits for the airport text adventure idea go to an old C++ tutorial for DOS from years ago by Coronado Enterprises I stumbled upon once. But the implementation in Unity using 'States' is mine)
